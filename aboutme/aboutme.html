        <p style=""><b>What's My Deal ?</b></p>
I'm all about creating things from scratch and despise those repetitive tasks. To tackle the mundane, I dive into the world of automation, using Python, Kubernetes, Git, AWX, Angular, C/C++, and Ansible. My playground includes maintaining robust server clusters, troubleshooting server issues, and crafting end-to-end tools like a wizard.

        <p><b>Life Beyond the Code:</b></p>
When I'm not in front of a screen, you'll likely find me jogging through the concrete jungle or swimming my way to serenity. 🏃‍♂️🏊 These activities not only keep me fit but also bring a perfect balance to my life.

        Currently, I'm rocking it as part of the awesome squad at Juniper Network. We're cooking up some serious software magic and I'm continually sharpening my skills in the process. This website? It's my digital diary, a place where I spill the beans on my learning journey, projects, and all the cool stuff happening in the software cosmos.
